# Exp1: Deterministic Finite State Automaton (DFA) for String Pattern Validation 
This program allows DFA to process strings consisting of 'a' and 'b' and accepts only those with an even number of 'a's and an odd number of 'b's.

# Exp2: Deterministic Finite State Automaton (DFA) for Binary Number Divisibility
This program allows DFA to check whether a given binary number is divisible by 5 or not using modulo 5 arithmetic.

# Exp3: Immediate Left Recursion
This program removes immediate left recursion if present in the production rules entered by the user
